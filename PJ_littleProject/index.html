    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
    web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
    JavaScript. <br>
    <br>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
    web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
    of the document. <br>
    <br>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <br>
    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
    paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br>
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce
    content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include
    other tags as sub-elements. <br>
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. <br>
    <br>
    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
    of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. <br>
    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
    encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]
